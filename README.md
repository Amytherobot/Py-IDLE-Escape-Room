Howdy!

This is the first game I coded in Python (and just, in general). I made in during my Intro to Python class after I learned how while loops worked. I immediately thought of an escape rooms gameloop and made it in my spare time that semester.
It's pretty straightforward, and was coded in IDLE and thus, made to run in IDLE. But, you can probably run it anywhere as long as Python is installed on your computer. Worst case scenario, double click it and it'll open something.
Hope you enjoy!!
